Extract the files you get when you download the program. If you can't find an .exe then chances are that you downloaded the source code and no the release. Click on the "DOWNLOAD HERE" link above.

When you have extracted the files open up Settings.exe and set up all your accounts, and when you are done click Start boosting or close the Settings program and start HourBoostr.exe manually. Enter the auth codes to login to your accounts and you're good to go. It takes maybe 1-2 minutes for accounts to appear online, and LoginKey will be received in roughly 5-10 minutes after logging in sucessfully.

You can find Steam game ids by going to the Steam store page for whatever game you wish to boost. For example the CSGO store page is http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 and the game id is 730. The same thing applies for all games. The Settings.exe program included can also fetch games for you if you enter your steam profile. Keep in mind that your profile needs to be public for this to work.
